import React from "react";

import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

// The import React from "react"; statement imports the React library, which is necessary to define and use React
// components. The import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; statement imports the ReactDOM library, which provides methods for
// rendering React components in the browser. The import "./index.css"; statement imports a CSS file called "index.css".
// This file likely contains styles specific to the application's root component or global styles that should be applied
// throughout the application. The import App from "./App"; statement imports the App component from a file called
// "App.js" or "App.jsx". The App component is the root component of the application and represents the main entry point
// for rendering the entire application. The ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root")); statement renders
// the App component and mounts it into the HTML element with the id "root". The ReactDOM.render() method takes two
// arguments: the first argument is the JSX expression <App /> which represents the root component to be rendered, and
// the second argument is the DOM element where the component will be inserted.
