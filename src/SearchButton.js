// It is a React component called SearchButton. It imports the React library. The SearchButton component is a functional
// component defined as an arrow function. It returns JSX representing the structure and content of the component's
// output. The JSX returned by the SearchButton component consists of a <button> element with the className
// "btn btn-primary". This suggests that the button is styled using Bootstrap classes to give it a specific appearance.
// The text "Search" is the content of the button, which is displayed as the label on the button. The SearchButton
// component is exported as the default export, allowing it to be imported and used in other files. Other files can
// import the SearchButton component using import SearchButton from "./SearchButton.js", assuming the file is in the
// same directory.
