    <h1>Glasgow</h1>
    <p>Glasgow is in west central Scotland. It’s Scotland’s largest city and is easily accessible from the rest of the UK and overseas by train, sea, road and air.

    Glasgow was created a royal burgh in 1450, and its university was founded in 1451. Glasgow prospered as a market centre because it was well situated between Highland and Lowland Scotland and also between Edinburgh—the capital, 45 miles (72 km) east—and the west.</p>
