            London is the capital and largest city of England and the United
            Kingdom.[9][10] Standing on the River Thames in south-east England
            at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, it
            has been a major settlement for two millennia.[11] The City of
            London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the
            Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval
            ones.[note 1][12][13][14][15][16] Since the 19th
            century,[17][18][19] "London" has also referred to the metropolis
            around this core, historically split between the counties of
            Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[20] which largely
            makes up Greater London,[21] the region governed by the Greater
            London Authority.[note 2][22][23][24] The City of Westminster, to
            the west of the City, has for centuries held the national government
            and parliament.
