/*
Write a React Component from Scratch

Now that you've learned the basics of JSX and React components, it's time to write a component on your own. React components are the core building blocks of React applications so it's important to become very familiar with writing them. Remember, a typical React component is an ES6 class which extends React.Component. It has a render method that returns HTML (from JSX) or null. This is the basic form of a React component. Once you understand this well, you will be prepared to start building more complex React projects.

  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById("challenge-node"))
